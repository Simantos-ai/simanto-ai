    <br>
    <p>Hi, my name is Simanto, and I'm a rising sophomore at MCSM. I'm passionate about coding and enjoy diving into exciting programming projects.<br>
    I recently started coding and joined the All Star summer intensive to enhance my tech skills and connect with others who share my enthusiasm.
    I'm excited to use my coding skills and really step into the next level. Besides coding, I have a deep passion for sports, particularly soccer and badminton. Wheater its casual or competive, im always trying my best which is a testament for my strong passion in these sports. </p>
